# Cypress 

Cypress is a very powerful end-to-end test system. 
We use Cypress for non-regression testing of the user interface. 
We also use [db-migrate](https://db-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to clean-up and reset the local database to a well know configuration before each test.

## How can I launch the tests?

First, check that the latest node packages are installed 

    yarn install

Second step : create a test user "Alice" on [keycloak](http://localhost:8082). Make sure Alice has role "user" and "admin". Set the password to 'alice'.

Then, execute the cypress command :

    yarn cypress
    
## How can I write a test?
